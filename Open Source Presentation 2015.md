# How to contribute back?

---

# STOP!

## Don't write code yet.

---

# First Step: 
# Identify the Problem

## Is the problem in the library, or with your implementation of it?

---

# Second Step: 
# Ask for Feedback

# (Before you write code!)

^ Is your solution an enhancement, a bug fix, or a modification?

---

# Third Step: 
# Make your contribution easy to accept

---

# Submit clean code

## Match the style of the library you're contributing to

---

# Write tests if you're fixing a bug

## And of course, test your code yourself

---

# Create beautiful programmer interfaces

## Eliminate typos, write documentation, think about your method names

---

# So why should you contribute?

---

# Improve the tools that you already use

## Part of being a good citizen in the developer community

---

# Learn about how things work

## Open a library up and read it. Figure out how it works. 
## Learn something new.

---

# Build your Portfolio

## Contributing to open source is great practice.

## It's good for your career!

---

# 3. Releasing Open Source

## Share openly
## Solve important problems

---

# Have you seen the same problem twice?

## Do you have a solution for it?

# Bingo!
